<strong>Pihole Taskbar Manager</strong> is a simple project I developed in WinForms to put a way to view your Pihole data quickly and easily in the SysTray. 

Once the program launches you can see it in the SysTray with no window by default.

From there once it's right clicked on you can view the Stats from your Pi-hole quickly or you can Configure the Program or finally Exit the program.

After clicking on Configure you are greeted with a page that enables you to choice which items actually show up on the Context Menus, change how often the data updates (Currently this needs a relaunch of the program), and finally to choose where you get the data.

This project is still new and definetly needs better error checking especially if the URL provided is inaccurate, but will update it as I can.

Finally I want to stress that <strong> I AM IN NO WAY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PI-HOLE PROJECT AND THIS PROGRAM IS NOT ENDORSED OR ASSOCIATED WITH THEM IN ANY WAY AT ALL.</strong>
